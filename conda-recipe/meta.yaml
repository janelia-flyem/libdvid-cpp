  ## A note about krb5:
  ## ------------------
  ## At the time of this writing, the newest version of krb5 is 1.16.2,
  ## but if I permit the 'build' environment to (implicitly) pull in that version,
  ## then something goes haywire and linker uses it when creating libdvid, despite the 'host'
  ## environment having an older version (due to the older 'curl').
  ##
  ## For the record, the error is:
  ##   ImportError: /opt/conda/conda-bld/libdvid-cpp_1543299620664/_build_env/lib/./libcom_err.so.3: symbol k5_os_mutex_destroy, version krb5support_0_MIT not defined in file libkrb5support.so.0 with link time reference
  ##
  ## To avoid that, I'm explicitly pinning the version of krb5 here in 'build' and in 'host',
  ## but surely that will need to change at some point, once we eventually update 'curl'.
