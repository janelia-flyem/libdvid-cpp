def view_as_blocks(arr_in, block_shape):
    """
    (Copied from scikit-image.)
    
    Block view of the input n-dimensional array (using re-striding).

    Blocks are non-overlapping views of the input array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr_in : ndarray
        N-d input array.
    block_shape : tuple
        The shape of the block. Each dimension must divide evenly into the
        corresponding dimensions of `arr_in`.

    Returns
    -------
    arr_out : ndarray
        Block view of the input array.  If `arr_in` is non-contiguous, a copy
        is made.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from skimage.util.shape import view_as_blocks
    >>> A = np.arange(4*4).reshape(4,4)
    >>> A
